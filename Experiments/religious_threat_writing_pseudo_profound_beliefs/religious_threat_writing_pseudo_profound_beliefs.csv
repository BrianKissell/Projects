78,2,The night before I received my Master's Degree in Education I attended a ceremony that was specifically for the Education graduates. During this ceremony we listened to various professors speak and awards were given to outstanding students. To my surprise I received the award for all of the graduate students. It was a surreal experience. I had to give a speech spur of the moment in front of the whole crowd of fellow students and their guests. After that each graduate was brought down to the stage one by one and was surrounded by professors. The professors prayed for each and every one of us and gave us blessing as we moved into our careers. It was the most spiritual event I have ever attended. I could feel the energy and the support and knew God was going to take care of me. My family even mentioned that it was the first time they truly believed in a higher power after witnessing this event. It was even more special because my young son (he was little at the time) was there to see me graduate after two years of hard work. My parents were also there that had supported me for those two years while I worked hard to get on my feet again as a single parent. I will never forget that experience for the rest of my life.

I walked to the grocery store to pick up some of the ingredients I would need for the dish. As usual, I ended up getting more than intended, and spent beyond my daily grocery budget. The walk to and from the grocery store is about 2 miles, so I rested a while before getting started on the dish. Since I hadn't cooked Asian food for a while it was a bit challenging to get the right balance of oil, garlic and other seasonings to create an authentic flavor.

82,1,"Coffee is an essential part of daily life.  I used to enjoy caffeine from soda, but after some time I realized that soda was incredibly bad for me.  The acidic nature in combination of the amount I would drink to reach the desired level of caffeine was disastrous.  Eventually, I became aware of coffee and have leveraged its benefits while completely eliminating consumption of soda from my diet.  The result here is that I get what I need while greatly limiting the negative effects on my body.  For example, only two cups of coffee in the morning decreases the time it takes for my brain to be fully operational by nearly one hour.  This allows me to wake up, prepare, and begin working at a high level within about thirty minutes time.  Additionally, the caffeine I get from coffee is so much more concentrated than in soda that I simply don't need to continue drinking all day.  I can drink my two cups and be completely alert and satisfied for the entire day.  Coffee has literally improved my life and, as far as I can tell, there are no negative effects on the body resulting from the consumption of caffeine.

I generally start past my cabin and as the first of my 20 peers to take the walk I get a faceful of spider webs, every time. I then trip over a small tree root. I convince myself that the next morning I will remember it is there and will not trip. I never remember. I then watch all the little plants covered in dew sway in the morning breeze. The dew covered spider webs are noticeably more beautiful when they aren't covering my face. Sometimes I'll see a doe, or a group of deer running, but typically I'll see quite a few gray squirrels hoping from tree to tree. I have yet to see a snake.
