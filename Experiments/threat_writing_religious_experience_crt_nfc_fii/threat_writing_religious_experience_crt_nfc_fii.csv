And I realized that if God would care if a dying woman had gotten everything 'right', if he would turn her away from heaven if she hadn't 'checked all the boxes', then that was a god that I wanted NO part of.  And so I began thinking.  And I thought - every people group in the world, for all of human history, has usually had some belief system - some deity or other.  What makes this ONE belief system, this ONE god (christianity, jesus, etc) the RIGHT one?  Doesn't it make more sense that ALL of them are wrong?  I mean - how arrogant.  And then I considered how so many of the religious stories and beliefs are based on earlier stories and beliefs from other people groups, and I realized....humans tell stories.  That's what makes us human.  But it doesn't make the stories we tell *factual*.  So - there is no God.

My new boss was at odds with most other people in the company, and she seemed to be disappointed that I was not exactly like her old assistant. This made me feel very uncomfortable. I had contacted my old supervisor and asked for my old job back, but I was waiting to hear back from her. I knew that I would probably have to quit the new job before I heard back from the old job, and this was nervewracking because I wasn't sure how I would pay my bills if the old job didn't take me back. I was reading my Bible and praying, asking God what I should do. I came across a verse in Psalms about how God's power is reflected in his creation, and this intrigued me. I kept it in the back of my mind as I went about my day. Finally, I decided that I could not remain in my new job, and I quit before I heard back about the old job. As I was driving home that day, I saw a rainbow in the sky, and it put me in mind of the verse I had read, and how rainbows signified covenants. I knew everything was going to work out.

How can God be good and allow suffering to exist?  How can God allow suffering to exist when he can stop it?  Perhaps God is not good.  Perhaps God is not all powerful.  Perhaps God wants to stop suffering but can't.  Perhaps God is not god.  Because of this I would have considered my self an aetheist for a time. But I fell out with that, too.  There is no evidence one way or the other.  God's existence cannot be proven.  God's non-existence cannot be proven either.  Perhaps it doesn't matter.  Perhaps God is irrelevant.

112,1,A spiritual experience that I have had that convinced me of my spiritual beliefs was when I was 16 years old I had contemplated getting baptized for a few years but never was sure if I was ready to do it. I was also very scared to get up in front of the big church that I went to to confess my love for Jesus. I think many times that was what actually held me back more so than actually being ready to accept Jesus in my heart. One Sunday morning I had been thinking about it all of the service but again I was too scared to get up in front of the church. As we had closed out eyes to pray I had asked God to let me surrender my fear to him and for him to take the fear away and allow me to go up and accept him into my heart publicly. The preacher asked who was willing to accept Jesus publicly today if they had not done so before. Next thing i know I'm standing up. And i didn't feel like I was in control of my body.

I'd always followed Buddhism loosely, until the days after my beloved Maltese dog, Patrick, passed away, before his time. From a Buddhist ritual, we placed him before the Buddha, with the chanting of monks, so that he would pass safely into the next life.

I never thought I'd get over his death, and finally, after a few weeks of grief, we welcomed a new furry family member, Hercules, a Pekingese. From the start, it seemed like he had a lot in common with Patrick, and the two seemed very similar in personality. Then, the kicker came when he discovered his favorite stuffed toy...an old ratty raccoon toy, that just happened to be Patrick's (that we forgot to bury with him).

219,1,"I had been Christian, then Atheist, then Buddhist. I had gotten to the point where I didn't believe there was really a God but I wanted something to believe in. But that, said there were things that happened that didn't correspond to a world without a Creator, or complete inner connectedness. For instance, one day I was driving my kids to school. On the way to the school, something deep inside me told me to slow down because I was going to get into an accident....so I slowed down. Within two seconds of pushing down on the break a white SUV almost ran me off the access road. I felt exhilaration and fear all at once. My feeling and inner voice had been validated. From that moment on I could not stop thinking of how. How does science explain something like that? What is it that informed me to slow down? Was it God? An angel? No. I had to acclimate it to my beliefs in a way that worked. For me, science was the answer. So my thought from that moment was that there was a level of consciousness that we are all connected to that can relay information at the subconscious level.
