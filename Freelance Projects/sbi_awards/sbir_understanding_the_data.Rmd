# SBIR Award Data Set

The `sbir_awards` data set includes `r nrow(sbir_awards)` awards that
were scraped from sbir.gov. The data set includes information for
`r ncol(sbir_awards)` variables related to each award. Below, you can see information on each included variable. Please note that the data will be cleaned and processed throughout this document, and will then exported as a new csv.

```{r sbir_awards}
# Look over dataframe
glimpse(sbir_awards)
```

## Missing Data

Before beginning the analysis, I checked to evaluate whether there was missing data in the data set -- a visualization of the missing data can be seen below. While a large amount of data is missing, most of it falls in four variables (i.e., `solicitation_number`, `solicitation_year`, `award_start_date_proposal_award_date`, and `award_end_date_contract_end_date`). Due to the fact that the website did not contain a large portion of that data, I will not discuss those variables any further in the report.

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Are there any missing values
any_na(sbir_awards)

# How many values are missing?
n_miss(sbir_awards)

# What proportion is missing?
prop_miss(sbir_awards)

# What variables are missing data?
miss_var_summary(sbir_awards)

# What cases were missing data?
miss_case_summary(sbir_awards)
```

### Visualization of Missing Data

```{r, fig.height = 8}
# Create visualization of missing data.
vis_miss(sbir_awards, warn_large_data = FALSE)
```

# Variable Summaries for Categorical Variables

```{r}
# I shortened the names to make it easier to visualize
sbir_awards$branch <- factor(sbir_awards$branch, levels = c("Air Force", "Army", "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency", "Defense Health Program", "Defense Logistics Agency", "Defense Microelectronics Activity", "Defense Threat Reduction Agency", "Missile Defense Agency", "National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency", "Navy", "Office for Chemical and Biological Defense", "Special Operations Command"), labels = c("Air Force", "Army", "DARPA", "DHP", "DLA", "DMA", "DTRA", "MDA", "NGIA", "Navy", "OCBD", "SOC"))
```
```{r, include = FALSE}
# Read in the links for each award.
award_links <- read_csv("award_links.csv")

# Join this data with the sbir_awards data
df_full <- left_join(sbir_awards, award_links, by = c("link" = "award_links_full")) 

# Create a new variable for the phases, which specifies whether phase I led to phase II
df_full <- df_full %>%
  mutate(only_phase1 = ifelse(duplicated(df_full$award_names), 0, 1),
         phase1_with_phase2 = ifelse(duplicated(df_full$award_names) & phase == "Phase I", 1, 0))
df_full <- df_full %>%
  mutate(phases = ifelse(phase == 'Phase II', "Phase II", ifelse(only_phase1 == 1, "Phase I - No Phase II", ifelse(phase1_with_phase2 == 1, "Phase I - Obtained Phase II", NA))))

# Add new phase variable to sbir_awards dataframe
sbir_awards$phases <- factor(df_full$phases)

# Also add names of the awards to the data set.
sbir_awards$award_names <- df_full$award_names
```
```{r, include = FALSE}
sbir_awards_unavailable <- sum(sbir_awards$hubzone_owned == "Unavailable")

# Remove the Unavailable data from the data set
sbir_awards <- sbir_awards[-which(sbir_awards$hubzone_owned == "Unavailable"),]
```

`r round((sum(sbir_awards$agency == "Department of Defense")/nrow(sbir_awards)) * 100, 2)`% of the included awards are from the Department of Defense, which was by design. A majority of the awards came from five branches. These were the Air Force (`r round((sum(sbir_awards$branch == "Air Force")/nrow(sbir_awards)) * 100, 2)`%), the Navy (`r round((sum(sbir_awards$branch == "Navy")/nrow(sbir_awards)) * 100, 2)`%), the Army (`r round((sum(sbir_awards$branch == "Army")/nrow(sbir_awards)) * 100, 2)`%), the Missile Defense Agency (`r round((sum(sbir_awards$branch == "Missile Defense Agency")/nrow(sbir_awards)) * 100, 2)`%), and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (`r round((sum(sbir_awards$branch == "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency")/nrow(sbir_awards)) * 100, 2)`%). `r round((sum(sbir_awards$phase == "Phase I")/nrow(sbir_awards)) * 100, 2)`% of include awards were in Phase I, while `r round((sum(sbir_awards$phase == "Phase II")/nrow(sbir_awards)) * 100, 2)`% were in phase II. However, to allow us to distinguish between awards that only reached Phase I and those that reached Phase II, I created a new variable, `phases`. Using this variable, we can see that `r round((sum(sbir_awards$phases == "Phase I - Obtained Phase II")/nrow(sbir_awards)) * 100, 2)`% of Phase I awards were in the group that reached phase II. In other words, there was a success rate of `r round((sum(sbir_awards$phases == "Phase I - Obtained Phase II") / (sum(sbir_awards$phases == "Phase I - No Phase II") + sum(sbir_awards$phases == "Phase I - Obtained Phase II"))) * 100, 2)`% for reaching Phase II.  `r round((sum(sbir_awards$program == "STTR")/nrow(sbir_awards)) * 100, 2)`% of the awards were from the STTR program, while `r round((sum(sbir_awards$program == "SBIR")/nrow(sbir_awards)) * 100, 2)`% were from the SBIR program. `r sbir_awards_unavailable` from `hubzone_owned`, `woman_owned`, and `socially_and_economically_disadvantaged` were unavailable. To again improve the visualizations, these have been removed. `r round((sum(sbir_awards$hubzone_owned == "Y")/nrow(sbir_awards)) * 100, 2)`% of the awards were from hubzone_owned, while `r round((sum(sbir_awards$hubzone_owned == "N")/nrow(sbir_awards)) * 100, 2)`% were not from hubzone_owned. `r round((sum(sbir_awards$woman_owned == "Y")/nrow(sbir_awards)) * 100, 2)`% of the awards were from women owned businesses, while `r round((sum(sbir_awards$woman_owned == "N")/nrow(sbir_awards)) * 100, 2)`% were not women owned businesses.

# Exploration of Award Amount

```{r}
# Convert amount to a numeric variable
sbir_awards$amount <- str_remove_all(sbir_awards$amount,"\\$") %>% str_remove_all("\\,") %>% as.numeric()

data_with_outliers <- sbir_awards
```
```{r, include = FALSE}
# Create a list will all outliers
outliers_amount <- boxplot(sbir_awards$amount)$out

# Remove the outliers from the data set
sbir_awards <- sbir_awards[-which(sbir_awards$amount %in% outliers_amount),]
```

The average award amount is quite high, with a large amount of variability ($\mu$ = `r round(mean(data_with_outliers$amount), 2)`, *sd* = `r round(sd(data_with_outliers$amount), 2)`). There are a decent number of awards that received amounts much higher than most of the awards, which makes the distribution extremely skewed. In order to seek out patterns related to the majority of cases, I have removed `r length(outliers_amount)` outliers. If these outliers are of interest, further analyses can be conducted. The remaining awards have an average award that is still fairly high, although there is a great deal of variability ($\mu$ = `r round(mean(sbir_awards$amount), 2)`, *sd* = `r round(sd(sbir_awards$amount), 2)`). In addition, I have included a number of additional figures to explore the relationships between amount and the categorical variable. The plots are interactive (e.g., you can click on different element to adjust which elements are emphasized).

The oldest award included is from `r min(sbir_awards$award_year)`, and the most recent award is from `r max(sbir_awards$award_year)`. `r round((sum(sbir_awards$socially_and_economically_disadvantaged == "Y")/nrow(sbir_awards)) * 100, 2)`% of the awards were from socially and economically disadvantaged, while `r round((sum(sbir_awards$socially_and_economically_disadvantaged == "N")/nrow(sbir_awards)) * 100, 2)`% were not from socially and economically disadvantaged.

# Potential Future Directions


I am planning to write a second report, which will contain the analyses related to key words in the text, along with further exploration of this new data set. The following are some of the potential tasks I am considering. Please take a look, and please provide me with any feedback that you have. Also, if there are other things you are wanting me to dive into more deeply, please let me know. 

+ Create comparison plots (using a bag of words approach) to look at which words each phase has in common with the others.
+ Create difference plots (using a similar approach) to explore words that are uniquely used in each phase. 
+ Use topic modeling, to categorize, and determine the number of, the differing themes within the text. If you are unfamiliar, it is similar to factor analysis, but for textual data.
+ Feature extraction (i.e., pulling out additional factors from the text which can be used in future models). 
+ Create a classification model to predict amount of award based on the text in the titles and abstracts. 
+ There is also additional data within the recipient variable that might be interesting to explore.
+There are many other models that I would be interested in conducting, but I think it would be best to get your feedback regarding what you would like me to explore in greater detail.
